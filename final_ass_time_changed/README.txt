Multi-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) for Dike Model
This repository contains code and data related to the implementation of Multi-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) for a dike model. 
The project is focused on evaluating the robustness of policies under various scenarios for the Gelderland and Overijssel regions.
