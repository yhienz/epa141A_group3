    "1. $S(t)$ - the part of the population that is succeptible but not yet infected with the disease\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's connect this simple model to the workbench. We make the following assumptions\n",
    "1. $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are uncertain. We assume that $\\beta$ is somewhere between 0.05 and 0.3, while $\\gamma$ is somewhere between 0.01, and 0.15.\n",
    "2. The outcomes of interest are $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the model to the workbench, we need to do at least 3 things:\n",
    "1. **Instantiate a model class**; the workbench comes with a variety of model classes for making it easy to connect with existing simulation packages such as Vensim, PySD, Simio, or Netlogo. Since we have a model implemented in Python, we can use the most basic Model class.\n",
    "2. **Specify the uncertain parameters** (and/or decision levers); Note below how the name of the parameters matched the name of the keyword arguments of the SIR_model function. The workbench makes a distinction between RealParameters, IntegerParameters, BinaryParameters, and CategoricalParameters. For this example, our parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ have a continuous range so we use RealParameters \n",
    "3. **Specify the outcomes of interest**; the workbench makes a distinction between TimeSeriesOutcomes and ScalarOutcomes. $S$, $I$, and $R$ are time series, so we use TimeSeriesOutcomes"

The levers (not used in this example) span the lever space. A point in uncertainty space is a scenario. A point in lever space is a policy. The combination of a scenario and a policy (where either might be None) is an experiment. \n",
